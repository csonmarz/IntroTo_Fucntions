● Function Definition:
- A function definition consists of the new function's name and a block of statements. The
function's name can be any valid identifier.

● Function Call:
- A function call is an invocation of a function's name, causing the function's statements to
execute.

● Local Variable:
- A local variable is a variable declared in a function, which is then accessible only within
that function.

● Parameter:
- A parameter is a function input specified in a function definition.

● Argument:
- An argument is a value provided to a function's parameter during a function
call.

● Return Variable:
- A function may return one value by assigning a return variable .

● Return Value:
- Return value is returned along with a return variable.

● Modular Development:
- Modular Development is separating a program's 
functions into independent pieces or building blocks, 
each containing all the parts needed to execute 
a single aspect of the functionality.

● Incremental Development:
- Incremental development in software engineering is a process methodology 
that emphasizes the virtue of taking small steps 
toward the goal.

● Function Stub:
- A Function Stub  helps write the test and serves as a kind of 
scaffolding to make it possible to run the examples 
even before the function design is complete.
